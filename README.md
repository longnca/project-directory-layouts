# Project Directory Layouts

![GitHub last commit (by committer)](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/longbytes/Project-Directory-Layouts)

This repo is to show structured directory layouts for three types of projects. The key to these layouts is ensuring they align with the project's workflow and make it easy for anyone working on or reviewing the project to find what they need. Please keep in mind that these layouts are just my personal preferences and they can be easily changed to fit my personal project's requirements. Nothing is written in stone.

## Good References:

I found some good resoursces related to project directory layouts as follows.

  - Data is immutable. (i.e. Do *not* edit the raw data!)
  - Notebooks are for exploration and communication.
  - Build from the environment up.
  - Keep secrets and configuration out of version control (shhh! :speak_no_evil:).
